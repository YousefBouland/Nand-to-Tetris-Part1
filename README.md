# Nand-to-Tetris-Part1
This project-centered course is focused on building the hardware for a simple 16-bit computer starting from Nand gates

## Description
The Nand to Tetris course takes you on a self-paced fascinating voyage of discovery in which you will go all the way from Boolean algebra and elementary logic gates to building a Central Processing Unit, a memory system, and a hardware platform, leading up to a general-purpose computer that can run any program that you fancy. In the process of building this computer you will become familiar with many important hardware abstractions, and you will implement them, hands on. But most of all, you will enjoy the tremendous thrill of building a complex and useful system from the ground up.

## Projects Overview
- Project 1: Building elementary logic gates such as And, Or, Not and Multiplexor.
- Project 2: Building a family of adder chips, culminating in the construction of an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU).
- Project 3: Building registers and memory units, culminating in the construction of a Random Access Memory (RAM).
- Project 4: Learning a machine language and using it to write some illustrative low-level programs.
- Project 5: Using the chipset built in projects 1-3 to build a Central Processing Unit (CPU) and a hardware platform capable of executing programs written in the machine language introduced in project 4.
- Project 6: Developing an assembler, i.e. a capability to translate programs written in symbolic machine language into binary, executable code.

## Software Needed
Projects are built uing a simple Hardware Description Language (HDL), learned in the course, and a hardware simulator. A hardware simulator is a software system that enables building and simulating logic gates and chips before actually committing them to silicon. This is exactly what hardware engineers do in practice: they build and test computers in simulation, using HDL and hardware simulators.
